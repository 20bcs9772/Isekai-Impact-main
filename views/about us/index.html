						<span>Back End Developer</span>
						<p>Well as being a back end developer it was really hard for to create and link each and every game to data which in been seems to be impossible as a task, but as we started to develop the website piece by piece everything started to fall at their palces.It was a really fun project for me.</p>

						<span>Front End Developer</span>
						<p>In starting of this project, it seems to be impossible. It was really hard to pull this project over in such a limited time, but I’m glad that I was able to keep my project design modern yet simple. But I really want to thank my friends who were able to bring this project to life.</p>
